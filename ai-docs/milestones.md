# Milestones — web-agent porting roadmap

Consolidated roadmap for porting `packages/coding-agent`'s feature set into `packages/web-agent/` under our browser/RPC/ZenFS constraints. Living document — updated as each milestone lands.

**Structure.** The status board below is the canonical one-line-per-milestone index. Each planned milestone has a short preview describing scope, coding-agent reference sources, key adaptations, and the test seam that gates completion. The preview is the *input* to writing a detailed per-milestone implementation plan at `ai-docs/plans/<milestone>.md`; the preview is not itself the plan.

**Process.** One milestone at a time: draft the per-milestone plan → implement → gate-check → commit → move to next. The [milestone gate](#milestone-gate) lists the checks every commit must pass.

## Milestone previews

### M2 — Vault mount (ZenFS + FSA picker + dev-seed seam)

**Why first (among planned).** Every downstream milestone that touches files needs the mount. No fs capability in the product means no meaningful tools, no sessions, no extensions storage. The dev-seed seam is also a prerequisite for testing all future fs-dependent work without the user-gesture-gated picker.

**Scope preview.**
- Add `@zenfs/core`, `@zenfs/dom`, `idb-keyval` as `packages/web-agent` deps.
- `src/web-agent/fs/zenfs-provider.ts` — pure `mountVault(handle)` / `unmountVault()`, no React.
- `src/hooks/useDirectoryHandle.ts` — pick folder, persist handle in IndexedDB, re-grant permission on reload.
- `src/hooks/useDevSeedBoot.ts` — dev-mode-only seam reading `window.__zenfsSeed`, mounting InMemory ZenFS before React renders. Tree-shakes in production.
- `e2e/helpers/install-vault.ts` — Node-side helper walking `e2e/data/<name>/` and injecting via `page.addInitScript`.
- Minimal UI: folder-picker button + vault-status indicator.

**Coding-agent references.** No direct equivalent — node uses real fs. Architectural reference is `bodhiapps/zenfs-browser`.

**Gate.** Playwright spec seeds a 3-file vault, assertions confirm the file tree UI surfaces them.

### M3 — Filesystem tools

**Scope preview.**
- Port tool schemas from `packages/coding-agent/src/core/tools/{read,write,edit,ls,glob,grep}.ts`. Keep the "operations" dependency-injection pattern.
- Swap node-fs operations for ZenFS `fs.promises` operations. Both produce the same `AgentToolResult`.
- Register the six tools on `AgentSession` by default; host app passes the session's tools to `session.setTools(...)` on mount.
- Honor the coding-agent file-mutation-queue pattern from `packages/coding-agent/src/core/tools/file-mutation-queue.ts` to prevent write-races across concurrent tool calls.

**Coding-agent references.** `packages/coding-agent/src/core/tools/{read,write,edit,ls,glob,grep,file-mutation-queue}.ts`.

**Gate.** Playwright spec seeds vault with `hello.txt`, prompts the agent to read and transform, asserts the derived file's content. Tool-level vitest for each operation adapter against an InMemory ZenFS.

### M4 — Worker transport

**Why now.** Locks in structured-clone discipline before we add more state (sessions, compaction, extensions). Moving to a Worker later becomes a bigger rewrite the longer we wait.

**Scope preview.**
- Spawn an agent Worker from the app; instantiate `AgentSession` + RPC server inside.
- Implement `createWorkerTransportPair()` backed by a `Worker` + `MessagePort`, same `Transport` interface as `createInProcessTransportPair()`.
- Decide mount location for ZenFS handles: main thread + proxy vs. Worker-side mount. Benchmark + verify FSA handle transferability, record decision in `05-decisions.md`.
- Proxy-tool pattern: tools carrying closures become host-side stubs that RPC back to the main thread.

**Coding-agent references.** `packages/coding-agent/src/modes/rpc/rpc-mode.ts` for the stdio transport pattern — we mirror the dispatcher shape; the transport itself is ours.

**Gate.** All previously green tests stay green. No new functional tests — this is purely an architectural shift.

### M5 — Session persistence (`/sessions` mount)

**Scope preview.**
- ZenFS IndexedDB mount at `/sessions`.
- Layout: `/sessions/<id>/meta.json`, `/sessions/<id>/entries.jsonl` (append-only entry log).
- Entry types mirror coding-agent: user message, assistant message, tool call, tool result, model change, compaction entry, custom entry.
- RPC commands: `list_sessions`, `load_session`, `save_session`, `delete_session`, `set_session_name`.
- On app boot: auto-load most-recent session if present.

**Coding-agent references.** `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-manager.ts` (file layout + entry types), `agent-session.ts` (persistence hooks on turn_end).

**Adaptations.** No file locks (IndexedDB transactions give us atomicity). No lockfile path. Concurrent-tab writes tolerated via IndexedDB serialisation.

**Gate.** Playwright spec: chat → reload page → session restored; list shows the session; rename, delete, re-chat.

### M6 — Session tree (fork, switch, branch navigation)

**Scope preview.**
- Fork: given an entry id, create a new session whose `parent` points to the source and whose `entries.jsonl` is a copy of the source's entries up to and including that id.
- Switch: load a different session in place. Abort any in-flight turn first.
- Branch summary entries: when forking mid-session, record a `BranchSummaryEntry` in both parent and child for traceability.
- RPC commands: `fork`, `switch_session`, `get_branches`.

**Coding-agent references.** `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-manager.ts` (tree traversal, `BranchSummaryEntry`), `agent-session-runtime.ts` (switchSession, fork).

**Gate.** Playwright: start chat, fork mid-conversation, continue on fork, switch back to original, confirm both branches keep independent state.

### M7 — Compaction

**Scope preview.**
- Auto-compaction threshold: when context token estimate crosses a configurable percentage of the model's context window, compact.
- Manual compaction: explicit RPC command.
- Compaction uses the same model the session is on (so user doesn't pay to switch).
- Result persisted as a `CompactionEntry` in the session's `entries.jsonl`.
- Extension hook `session_before_compact` can block, replace, or mutate the compaction payload — depends on M8 landing first, *or* implemented as internal-only with the extension hook wired up when M8 lands.

**Coding-agent references.** `packages/coding-agent/src/core/compaction/compaction.ts`, `compaction/branch-summarization.ts`, `compaction/utils.ts`.

**Gate.** vitest asserting threshold triggers + entry persisted correctly. Playwright step confirming UI reflects compacted state (the chat view still renders coherently post-compaction).

### M8 — Extensions + skills

**Biggest milestone.** Intentionally grouped: extension hooks are the surface other milestones depend on (compaction hooks, custom tools, custom providers), so building them late means plumbing we didn't yet have when those landed.

**Scope preview.**
- `/extensions` ZenFS mount (IndexedDB backend).
- Extension manifest schema (TypeBox-based, matching how `pi-agent-core` tools already declare schemas).
- Loader: download manifest + bundle, persist to `/extensions/<name>/`, instantiate in a dedicated Web Worker, wire RPC-backed capability channel.
- Port the full extension event surface from `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/types.ts`, trimmed to browser-safe pieces (drop terminal-UI concerns, drop `UserBashEvent`).
- Extension API: `on(event)`, `registerTool`, `registerCommand`, `registerProvider`, `sendMessage`, `sendUserMessage`.
- Manifest permissions: `fs:self`, `fs:vault` (requires user approval), `net:<origin>` allow-list.
- Skills-as-extensions: one reference skill shipped as an extension, validates surface expressiveness (matches goal K1–K4 in `01-goals.md`).

**Coding-agent references.** `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/{types,runner,loader,wrapper}.ts` — copy types, wrapper runtime; *replace* the jiti-based loader with browser ES-module dynamic import inside a Worker.

**Adaptations.** No jiti, no filesystem-as-module-resolver. Extensions ship pre-compiled ESM. Each extension in its own Worker (isolation + termination). Host intermediates all capabilities — extensions have no direct DOM, fetch, or global access.

**Gate.** Playwright: install an `uppercase-echo` extension, prompt the agent, confirm the extension's `after_tool_call` hook fires and mutates the tool output. vitest covering extension lifecycle (install / load / reload / uninstall / permission denial).

### M9 — Resources (commands, prompts, themes)

**Scope preview.**
- Resource loader pattern: extensions can contribute slash commands, prompt templates, themes by declaring them in their manifest or calling `registerCommand`/`registerPromptTemplate`/`registerTheme` at load.
- Slash-command registry: builtin commands + extension-provided commands. `/command-name args...` from the chat input triggers the command handler.
- Prompt templates with frontmatter-style metadata (scope, variables, description) like coding-agent's but as ESM not YAML-in-filesystem.
- Theme registration optional for v1 (UI can ship with two built-in themes and defer custom themes).

**Coding-agent references.** `packages/coding-agent/src/core/{slash-commands,resource-loader,prompt-templates,skills}.ts`.

**Gate.** vitest covering: builtin `/help` works; extension-registered `/echo-extension` works; command with autocomplete suggestions.

### M10 — Polish (HTML export, diagnostics, logging)

**Scope preview.**
- HTML export: render a session to self-contained HTML (inline CSS, embedded images). Reuse coding-agent's `export-html/` logic (already mostly node-fs-free, just emits HTML).
- Diagnostics collection: pluggable event subscribers record timings, tool call latencies, model response sizes. Available via RPC command `get_diagnostics`.
- Debug log level: `RpcClient.setLogLevel('debug')` dumps the full event stream to console for easier triage.

**Coding-agent references.** `packages/coding-agent/src/core/export-html/*`, `diagnostics.ts`, `timings.ts`, `event-bus.ts`.

**Gate.** vitest for export HTML generation (smoke-level). Manual verification for diagnostics / logging.

### M11 — Library extraction

**Scope preview.**
- Move `packages/web-agent/src/web-agent/` into its own npm-publishable package (working name `@bodhiapp/web-agent`).
- Reshape current `packages/web-agent/` into a reference app consuming the extracted package.
- Add architectural lint rule enforcing the "imports inward only" invariant (principle #3).
- Peer deps: `react`, `@mariozechner/pi-ai`, `@mariozechner/pi-agent-core`.
- Existing Playwright specs run against the consumer wiring without modification — validates the public API is sufficient.

**Gate.** `npm run build` produces the package; `npm publish --dry-run` clean; all tests pass against the extracted form.

## Per-milestone outcome summaries

### M0 — Workspace integration + Vite-warning fix (done, `06d02b81`)

What landed:

- `packages/web-agent` aligned with monorepo (typescript `^5.9.2`, `@types/node ^22.10.5`, `@mariozechner/{pi-ai,pi-agent-core}` as `"*"` for workspace symlinks).
- Vite no longer emits warnings about `packages/ai`'s node-only lazy imports — `/* @vite-ignore */` hints added in the `pi-ai` source.
- Biome scoped out of `packages/web-agent`; root `tsgo --noEmit` skips it; root `build` and `check` invoke web-agent's own tooling.
- `ai-docs/` directory established at repo root with `decisions.md` (now `05-decisions.md`) capturing D1–D4.
- Package `typecheck` script fixed from the dead `tsc --noEmit` (empty `files` array in project-references tsconfig) to `tsc -b`.

### M1 — RPC-shaped scaffold (done, `06d02b81`)

What landed:

- `packages/web-agent/src/web-agent/` tree established.
- `core/agent-session.ts` — thin wrapper over `pi-agent-core`'s `Agent` with a plain-data surface.
- `core/extensions/{types,registry}.ts` — minimal stubs, M8 extends.
- `core/tools/index.ts` — empty stub, M3 populates.
- `rpc/transport.ts` — the `Transport` interface.
- `rpc/transports/in-process.ts` — MessageChannel-backed pair.
- `rpc/rpc-types.ts` — `RpcCommand` / `RpcResponse` / `RpcEventEnvelope` schema.
- `rpc/rpc-server.ts` — dispatcher + exported `AgentSessionHost` interface.
- `rpc/rpc-client.ts` — typed promise + event-subscription client.
- `rpc/rpc.test.ts` — 4 round-trip tests against a fake session.
- `index.ts` — barrel.
- `hooks/useAgent.ts` rewired through `RpcClient`; public hook shape preserved, components untouched.

Surprises worth remembering (also captured inline in code/commit):

- `RpcServer` is retained automatically via the transport's event-listener closure — no module-level variable needed.
- `Omit<Union, K>` is non-distributive and drops per-variant fields; use a `DistributiveOmit` helper.
- `tsc --noEmit` at a package with project-references tsconfig silently checks zero files — use `tsc -b`.

### M2 — Vault mount (done, this commit)

What landed:

- `@zenfs/core ~2.5.6`, `@zenfs/dom ~1.2.9`, `idb-keyval ^6.2.2` added as dependencies; `fake-indexeddb` added dev-side for vitest.
- `src/web-agent/fs/zenfs-provider.ts` — `mountVault(handle)`, `unmountVault()`, `isVaultMounted()`, `setMountedForSeed()`; pattern copied from `bodhiapps/zenfs-browser`.
- `src/web-agent/fs/path-utils.ts` — `resolveVaultPath()` + `VaultPathError`, with 12 unit tests covering relative/absolute/escape cases.
- `src/hooks/useDirectoryHandle.ts` — three-state (`empty`/`prompt`/`ready`) with idb-keyval persistence and `requestPermission` re-grant.
- `src/hooks/useDevSeedBoot.ts` — dev-only, reads `window.__zenfsSeed`, lazy-imports InMemory vault adapter. Tree-shakes in production.
- `src/fs/in-memory-vault.ts` — InMemory ZenFS adapter used exclusively by the dev-seed path. Module-level mount guard makes it idempotent (two React subtrees both call `useVaultMount` and we must not reconfigure the VFS mid-session).
- `src/hooks/useVaultMount.ts` — orchestrates seed-vs-handle; exposes `VaultMountStatus` + display name.
- `src/components/vault/VaultStatus.tsx` — `data-testid="vault-status"` badge + pick / re-grant / close buttons; wired into `<Header>`.
- `src/types/fsa.d.ts` — type augmentations for FSA permission methods (TypeScript's DOM lib still lacks them).
- `e2e/helpers/install-vault.ts` + `e2e/data/sample/*` + `e2e/tests/pages/VaultPage.ts` + `e2e/vault-fs.spec.ts` (M2 describe block) — Playwright seam proven end-to-end.

Surprises worth remembering:

- Two React subtrees both calling `useVaultMount` triggered a double-mount race that wiped agent writes mid-turn. Fixed with a module-level `mountPromise` guard in `in-memory-vault.ts`.
- `FileSystemDirectoryHandle.requestPermission` is not in TypeScript's DOM lib — ships a local `fsa.d.ts` augmentation.
- Jsdom has no `indexedDB`; `fake-indexeddb/auto` added to `src/test/setup.ts` so component tests that mount the full App (and therefore the vault hooks) do not throw on boot.

### M3 — Filesystem tools (done, this commit)

What landed:

- `src/web-agent/fs/zenfs-operations.ts` — per-tool operations adapters and a `createZenfsVaultOperations()` factory.
- `src/web-agent/core/tools/file-mutation-queue.ts` — per-path serialisation (pattern copied from coding-agent; `realpathSync` step dropped because ZenFS backends don't expose symlinks).
- `src/web-agent/core/tools/truncation.ts` — dual (lines + bytes) truncation helper.
- `src/web-agent/core/tools/{read,write,edit,ls,glob,grep}.ts` — schemas + `create*Tool({ operations, cwd })` factories. Schemas ported verbatim where possible; `grep` and `glob` re-implemented in pure JS (no ripgrep / fd subprocess available in browser) via minimatch + tree walk.
- `src/web-agent/core/tools/index.ts` — `createVaultTools(ops)` one-call factory returning `AgentTool[]`.
- `src/hooks/useVaultTools.ts` — returns the six tools when the vault is mounted, empty array otherwise.
- `src/components/chat/ChatDemo.tsx` — merges vault tools with MCP tools before passing to `useAgent`.
- `src/components/chat/ToolCallMessage.tsx` — added `data-testid="tool-call"` + `data-tool` + `data-teststate` for black-box assertions.
- `e2e/vault-fs.spec.ts` M3 describe block — full agent round-trip: seeded vault → prompt → agent calls `read` and `write` tools → derived file verified via the InMemory fs.
- Added `minimatch ^10.0.1` dependency for glob/grep pattern matching.

Surprises worth remembering:

- `TextDecoder` strips the BOM by default in UTF-8 mode, which broke `edit`'s BOM-preservation invariant. Pass `{ ignoreBOM: true }` to keep it in the decoded string.
- `AgentTool<Concrete>` is not a subtype of `AgentTool<TSchema>` in TS because `params: Static<TParams>` is a contravariant position that collapses under the broader `TSchema`. `createVaultTools` uses `as unknown as AgentTool[]` at the factory boundary; runtime safety is preserved because the agent loop validates arguments against `parameters` before dispatch.
- ESLint's `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` rule flags synchronous `setState` inside effect bodies even for trivial cases. `useVaultMount` wraps all state transitions in awaited promise chains; don't short-circuit with a sync setState even when the rest of the effect is sync.

### Post-M3 stabilisation + reference-app polish (done, `dcd75a1c` → `bf68d906` → `4c3401d3`)

Three follow-up commits landed after the initial M2+M3 commit. They don't open a new milestone — they fix gaps the user surfaced during review and bring the reference app's UI up to the shape downstream milestones (M5 sessions, M6 fork, M8 extensions) will lean on.

**`dcd75a1c` — black-box vault side panel for e2e assertions.**

- Replaced the `window.__zenfsFs` whitebox hook (introduced in `2c437c0f`) with a real UI: `useVaultFiles` hook polling ZenFS every 500ms, `FileTree` + `FileViewer` + `VaultPanel` components. Both `vault-fs.spec.ts` describe blocks now assert through locators — `vault.waitForFile(path)`, `vault.openFile(path)`, `vault.currentFileContent()`. No `page.evaluate` reaching into ZenFS anywhere.
- Driver: principle #4 (black-box e2e). The original M2/M3 spec satisfied the gate but reached around the UI; user flagged it during review. The fix is invariant for every fs-touching milestone going forward.

**`bf68d906` — stable vault mount + collapsible tree.**

- Hoisted vault mount state into a single `<VaultProvider>` (`src/providers/{VaultProvider.tsx,vault-context.ts}`). Three components (Header, VaultPanel, ChatDemo) were each calling `useVaultMount`, which meant the mount effect ran in parallel from each subtree. The last racer won the actual VFS mount (so files rendered) but an earlier racer threw on a half-configured VFS and pinned `status` to `"error"` on reload. After hoisting, the mount effect runs exactly once per app.
- Added in-flight promise guard inside `mountVault`/`unmountVault` so React StrictMode effect re-runs and fast-refresh remounts serialise; mounting the same handle twice is a no-op.
- Replaced the flat file list with a nested collapsible tree. `useVaultTree` returns `VaultTreeNode[]`; `FileTree` renders recursive `TreeNode`s with chevron + folder icons. Folders render `data-testid="vault-dir-entry"` + `data-teststate="expanded|collapsed"` so the e2e helper can walk the ancestor chain.
- See [decision D5](05-decisions.md) for the rationale on hoisting mount state.

**`4c3401d3` — 3-column layout + Milkdown markdown viewer.**

- Restructured `Layout.tsx` into `[VaultPanel | FileViewer | ChatDemo (420px)]`, mirroring `bodhiapps/zenfs-browser`. Selected-path state lifted into `Layout` so the tree (left) and viewer (middle) stay synchronised without a context.
- Markdown files (`.md` / `.mdx` / `.markdown`) render through Milkdown Crepe WYSIWYG with autosave (blur + 5s) writing back through `fs.promises.writeFile` — proves the FSA round-trip end-to-end. Non-markdown text files keep the read-only `<pre>` viewer; unrecognised extensions show a placeholder.
- Folders default collapsed; auto-expand removed. `VaultPage.expandAncestors()` walks the parent chain and click-expands collapsed dirs so existing nested-path assertions (`/vault/src/hello.ts`, `/vault/docs/note.txt`) still work without touching the specs.
- `currentFileContent()` reads from Milkdown's ProseMirror root for markdown files; the seeded README assertion changes from `# Sample vault` to the rendered `Sample vault`.
- New deps: `@milkdown/{crepe,kit,react}`. See [decision D6](05-decisions.md) for the scope rationale.

Surprises worth remembering:

- A double-mount race that initially looked like a mount-guard issue inside `in-memory-vault.ts` was actually two separate React subtrees both running the mount effect. The module-level `mountPromise` guard kept the InMemory backend coherent but couldn't stop the WebAccess path racing once we put real FSA handles into play. Lifting state into a provider is the only durable fix.
- React StrictMode's double-invoking effects compounds with the mount race — the in-flight promise guard inside `mountVault` is what makes StrictMode safe. Don't remove it without re-testing the dev-mode reload path.
- Milkdown's `getMarkdown()` can throw if called before the editor finishes initialising; flush via `try/catch` around it. The dirty flag also has to be cleared *before* the async save so blur-then-blur doesn't double-write.

### M4 — Worker transport (done, `8fa325a6`)

What landed:

- **Single agent Worker per tab.** Spawned via Vite's native `new Worker(new URL('./agent-worker.ts', import.meta.url), { type: 'module' })` from a module-singleton in `src/web-agent/worker/boot.ts`. Hosts AgentSession + the real ZenFS mount + the six vault tools. Boot returns `{ rpcClient, vfsPort, worker }` for the rest of the app.
- **Dual MessageChannels.** ChannelA (agent RPC, existing protocol) and ChannelB (ZenFS Port backend, ZenFS-internal protocol) — both transferred together in a single tagged init message. Cribbed from Comlink: every init envelope carries `type: '__webAgent_init'` and is matched by `isAgentWorkerInit` so the worker ignores unrelated messages.
- **ZenFS Port backend.** Worker runs the real backend (`@zenfs/dom`'s `WebAccess` wrapping the FSA handle, or `@zenfs/core`'s `InMemory` for the dev seed). Main thread runs `Port.create({ port: vfsPort })` so every `fs.promises.*` call from `useVaultTree` / `FileViewer` / `MarkdownEditor` auto-marshals over the channel. UI consumers' code didn't change.
- **WorkerAgentHost** (`src/web-agent/worker/worker-host.ts`) implements `AgentSessionHost` for the Worker side: passthrough delegates for the existing surface, plus `mountVault`, `unmountVault`, `mountDevSeed`, `setMcpTools`, `setAuthToken`. Vault tools execute fully inside the Worker against worker-local ZenFS — no per-call RPC hop.
- **MCP tool upcall pattern.** MCP clients hold the bodhiClient + auth context (React-context-bound), so they stay on main. Worker host builds plain proxy tools whose `execute` emits a `tool_call_request` event over ChannelA; main's `RpcClient.setToolCallHandler` runs the actual MCP call and posts back a `tool_call_response`. This is the same pattern M8 extensions will use for sandboxed tools.
- **`set_auth_token` push.** Auth tokens are mutated on main (React's `useBodhi` hook). `useAgent` pushes them to the Worker via `rpcClient.setAuthToken(token)` on every change. The Worker's `streamFn` closes over `session.getAuthToken()` and reads synchronously per request — no upcall on the streaming hot path.
- **Structured error round-trip.** `serializeError` / `deserializeError` (`src/web-agent/rpc/error.ts`) preserve `{ name, message, stack }` across the boundary so tool / mount / model errors surface in the chat UI with their original stack frames. RpcResponse error shape changed from `error: string` to `error: SerializedError`.
- **`bootInProcess` fallback** for jsdom/vitest: when `Worker` is undefined the boot module spawns a local AgentSession + WorkerAgentHost paired through `createInProcessTransportPair`. Same RpcClient API, no real thread separation. Keeps `App.test.tsx` smoke-rendering without a Worker shim.
- **New tests.** `src/web-agent/rpc/error.test.ts` (5 tests, error round-trip) + `src/web-agent/rpc/transports/worker.test.ts` (3 tests, init envelope + transferable ports + channel echo). 70/70 vitests pass; existing 3 e2e specs unchanged.
- **Refactors.** `useVaultTools` deleted (vault tools now Worker-side). `useMcpAgentTools` returns `{ descriptors, handler }` instead of `AgentTool[]`. `WebAgentProvider` mounts the boot singleton near the React root; `VaultProvider` consumes the rpcClient + vfsPort via context. `in-memory-vault.ts` shrunk to a `readDevSeed()` helper.

Surprises worth remembering:

- **Both ends of a transferred MessagePort need `port.start()`.** ZenFS `RPC.from(channel)` uses `addEventListener('message', ...)` which queues messages until `start()` runs. Without explicit start on either side, `PortFS.ready()` would `RPC request timed out` after the default 250ms even though both sides looked correctly wired. Fix: call `port.start()` in `agent-worker.ts` for the worker side and inside `mountVaultPort` for the main side. Worth bumping PortFS timeout from 250ms to 5000ms anyway — first round-trip can race the Worker module evaluation.
- **`FileSystemDirectoryHandle` is structured-cloneable but not transferable.** `worker.postMessage(handle)` deep-clones the handle; both threads end up with their own clone over the same underlying entry. Permission state IS shared via the entry, so a `requestPermission({ mode: 'readwrite' })` granted on main is visible to the worker's clone — no second user gesture needed. Verified with `handle.queryPermission()` in the worker returning `'granted'` immediately.
- **VaultProvider's mount-trigger effect must not await its own state transitions.** First version used `setMountState({ tag: 'mounting' })` then `await rpcClient.mountVault(handle)` then `setMountState({ tag: 'mounted' })` inside one effect. The first `setState` re-runs the effect; the prior run's cleanup sets `cancelled = true`; the await resolves, but `if (cancelled) return` skips the final transition — so the UI stayed at `mounting` forever. Fix: pull the mount call out of the effect lifecycle entirely; track in-flight by handle reference via a ref.
- **Worker logs don't show in the page console via Claude in Chrome's `read_console_messages`.** During debug, forwarded debug messages back to main via `worker.postMessage({ __debug: '...' })` and had main's `worker.onmessage` re-emit via `console.log`. Useful pattern when debugging tool that can only see the page console. Removed from the final code.
- **Vite's worker import** (`new Worker(new URL('./agent-worker.ts', import.meta.url), { type: 'module' })`) bundles the worker into its own chunk. Worker chunk is ~1.9MB unminified (carries pi-ai's 30+ provider adapters + ZenFS WebAccess) — splitting moves it off the main entry but doesn't shrink either side; future work for a separate milestone.

### M5 — Session persistence (done, _this commit_)

What landed:

- **`/sessions` IndexedDB mount.** `WorkerAgentHost.initSessions()` calls `@zenfs/dom`'s `IndexedDB.create({ storeName: 'web-agent-sessions' })` and `vfs.mount('/sessions', ...)`. Guarded by a module-level flag so StrictMode / fast-refresh re-invocations are no-ops. Called from `agent-worker.ts` boot before any session RPC flows.
- **Entry-type surface ported 1:1 from coding-agent** in `src/web-agent/core/session/types.ts`: `SessionHeader`, full 9-variant `SessionEntry` union, `SessionTreeNode`, `SessionContext`, `SessionSummary`, `SessionMeta`, and a `ReadonlySessionManager` interface shaped exactly like coding-agent's `ExtensionContext.sessionManager` Pick type. Writing M5 only exercises `SessionMessageEntry` + `SessionInfoEntry` + `ModelChangeEntry`; the other variants are scaffolded so M6/M7/M8 plug into the same wire format without breaking changes.
- **Browser-native id helpers** in `src/web-agent/core/session/ids.ts`: `generateSessionId()` (UUIDv7 inline — 48-bit timestamp + 80 random bits, with a monotonic-counter bump for same-ms generations) and `generateEntryId()` (8-char hex with collision-check loop). No new dependency.
- **`SessionManager` class** (`src/web-agent/core/session/session-manager.ts`) — static factories (`create` / `open` / `list` / `delete` / `inMemory`), the full append surface (message / model_change / thinking_level_change / session_info / custom / custom_message / compaction / branch_summary / label_change), the full `ReadonlySessionManager` reads, plus `buildSessionContext()` and a `flush()` helper for tests + host-side shutdown. **Lazy flush** matches coding-agent: no file is written until the first assistant `message_end`; at that point header + buffered entries go out in one `writeFile`, subsequent entries `appendFile` a single JSONL line. Overlapping appends serialise through a per-session promise chain so JSONL line order stays stable under concurrent writers.
- **`WorkerAgentHost` session surface.** Constructor subscribes to the agent's `message_end` event and appends `user`/`assistant`/`toolResult` messages to the active `SessionManager`. New methods `listSessions`, `loadSession`, `newSession`, `deleteSession`, `setSessionName`, `getSessionMeta`, `setHostEventSink` — each wired through the RPC dispatch. `loadSession` flushes the previous manager, opens the target file, resets the agent, calls `AgentSession.restoreMessages(ctx.messages)`, then emits a synthetic `session_loaded` event through the host-event sink.
- **`AgentSession.restoreMessages(msgs)`** — simple reassignment of `agent.state.messages`. If pi-agent-core later adds derived caches we'd need to invalidate them explicitly; M5 doesn't need that.
- **RPC extensions** in `rpc-types.ts` / `rpc-server.ts` / `rpc-client.ts`: 6 new commands (`list_sessions`, `load_session`, `new_session`, `delete_session`, `set_session_name`, `get_session_meta`), each with its typed response. New event variant `RpcSessionLoadedEvent` (`sessionId` + `header` + `name` + `messages`) routed through a new `HostEventSink` seam — `RpcServer` calls `host.setHostEventSink?.(sink)` on construction and the sink forwards synthetic events through `transport.send`. `RpcClient.onSessionLoaded(listener)` is a separate stream from the existing `subscribe(envelope)` so agent-event consumers don't need to filter.
- **`useAgent` sessions API**: `sessions: { current, list, refresh, load, newSession, delete, rename }`. On mount (StrictMode-safe via a `sessionBootRef`) the hook reads `localStorage.activeSessionId`, calls `rpcClient.loadSession(storedId)`, and falls back to `newSession()` if the id is stale. `onSessionLoaded` updates messages + activeSession + localStorage in one handler, then kicks a `listSessions` refresh so the picker stays current. `clearMessages` now starts a fresh persisted session (old one stays accessible) instead of wiping the agent in place.
- **`SessionPicker.tsx`** mounted above `ChatMessages` in `ChatDemo`: popover dropdown with per-session summary (title / message-count / relative-time), a "New" button, per-row delete, and an inline rename form on the current session. All flows carry `data-testid` + `data-path` so e2e can drive the UI black-box.
- **Tests.** 26 new vitests total — 7 in `ids.test.ts` (UUIDv7 shape + monotonicity + 8-char entry id collision rate), 13 in `session-manager.test.ts` against InMemory ZenFS (create / lazy-flush / open round-trip / list / delete / setName / concurrency / malformed JSONL), 6 in `worker-host.test.ts` (full session lifecycle including session_loaded event emission), 5 in `rpc.test.ts` (round-trip list / new / load / setName / delete via `createInProcessTransportPair`). 103/103 vitests pass overall. New `e2e/session-persistence.spec.ts` (with `SessionPage` page object): send → reload → messages restored from localStorage id; new session → messages clear; switch back → messages return; delete other session via picker. Existing 70 vitests + 3 e2e specs unchanged.

Surprises worth remembering:

- **Parameter-property syntax is still disallowed** under `erasableSyntaxOnly` (repeated M4 finding). SessionManager's private constructor takes a single args object and assigns fields in the body.
- **`react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` fires on transitive setState.** An effect that awaits `refreshSessions()` still trips the rule because `refreshSessions` ends in `setSessionSummaries`. Fire the list-refresh inline from the `onSessionLoaded` subscriber (not an effect) — matches the M4 guidance about keeping state transitions out of effect lifecycles.
- **`AgentSession.state.messages` is writable but `errorMessage` / `streamingMessage` are readonly** in pi-agent-core's typing. `restoreMessages` only reassigns `messages`; a first version that also cleared the derived fields failed typecheck.
- **IndexedDB `appendFile` under ZenFS is O(file size)** — flagged in the plan, confirmed in practice. Sessions under ~100KB are fine; if long turns push a session past several MB, M7 will want to rework the storage layout (e.g., chunk files).
- **Lazy flush interacts with concurrent writes.** The per-session promise chain captures `[...fileEntries]` at enqueue time so the `hasAssistant` check inside the write body sees the state that was present when that entry was appended, not whatever the chain drains to. Without the snapshot, two rapid appends could both "see" no assistant and both skip writing even though an assistant did land in between.
- **`vfs.mount` throws if the path is already mounted.** SessionManager tests `try { vfs.umount } catch {}` before `vfs.mount` in `beforeEach` to keep each test isolated; the worker-host mount uses a module-level guard instead since it's a one-shot per Worker lifetime.

#### Post-script — Dexie storage swap (2026-04-20)

The original M5 storage path — `/sessions` mounted on `@zenfs/dom`'s IndexedDB backend with JSONL files per session — shipped but turned out to persist nothing in the browser. The ZenFS → `StoreFS` → `IndexedDBTransaction` write chain failed silently for reasons we did not pin down; IDB's `web-agent-sessions` store was empty after assistant replies despite the active session id being set in `localStorage`.

Rather than chase the failure mode inside ZenFS, M5's storage layer was replaced without touching the public interface. Sessions are now records in a Dexie-backed `web-agent` IDB DB behind a `SessionStore` interface (`src/web-agent/core/session/store.ts`). Writes live in the Worker, main-thread reads go through `useLiveQuery` — no RPC for the picker list, BroadcastChannel-backed cross-context reactivity for free. The full swap is documented at `ai-docs/plans/indexeddb-dexie-for-session.md` and captured as decisions D13/D14/D15 in `05-decisions.md`. See also `ai-docs/PENDING.md` for the coding-agent JSONL interop that was scope-deferred.

The extension-facing contract (`ReadonlySessionManager`, full `SessionEntry` union, `CURRENT_SESSION_VERSION = 3`) is unchanged, so M8 plans that assumed coding-agent-compatible session shape still hold.

The legacy `web-agent-sessions` IDB database is best-effort-deleted on Worker boot — no migration path, `localStorage` active-session id stays meaningful across the swap because both implementations use UUIDv7 ids.

### Post-M5 cleanup (2026-04-20, _this commit_)

Not a new milestone — a grouped cleanup commit landing before M6 opens. Driver: pre-extraction hygiene audit (`ai-docs/plans/we-want-to-create-luminous-book.md`).

What changed:

- **Dead-code removal.** Deleted `src/web-agent/core/extensions/registry.ts` (M8 stub, never instantiated). Dropped the Extension-related type re-exports from the public `index.ts` barrel; `core/extensions/types.ts` stays as forward-compat scaffolding. Narrowed `core/tools/index.ts` barrel (`truncateHead` / `formatSize` / `DEFAULT_MAX_*` / `TruncationResult` no longer re-exported — read.ts imports directly). Removed the legacy `SessionManager.flush()` no-op + its test.
- **Import hygiene.** `VaultProvider` + `WebAgentProvider` switched from sub-path (`@/web-agent/fs/zenfs-provider`, `@/web-agent/worker/boot`) to barrel (`@/web-agent`) imports. Principle #3 now has no sub-path consumers.
- **Configurability.** Introduced `WebAgentOptions` (`worker/init-protocol.ts`) carrying `vaultMount` + `sessionsDbName`. Threaded through `getAgentWorker({ agentOptions })` → `createWorkerTransportPair` → Worker init envelope → `agent-worker.ts` → `new WorkerAgentHost(..., { vaultMount })` + `new DexieSessionStore(new WebAgentDB(sessionsDbName))`. `WorkerAgentHost` stores `this.vaultMount` and uses it everywhere `VAULT_MOUNT` was referenced directly. `SessionManager.create` now requires explicit `cwd`; `DEFAULT_CWD` removed. `SENTINEL_API_KEY` renamed to `API_KEY_PRESENCE_PLACEHOLDER` with a comment explaining why the OpenAI provider layer needs it (real auth is Bearer-header based; the placeholder satisfies pi-ai's precondition check).
- **Test coverage gaps closed.** +24 new unit tests across 4 previously-uncovered modules: `core/agent-session.test.ts` (9), `core/tools/ls.test.ts` (7), `fs/zenfs-operations.test.ts` (10), `fs/zenfs-provider.test.ts` (5). 156 unit tests total (was 132).
- **Docs.** D16 (options) + D17 (extensions de-exported) appended to `05-decisions.md`. Library-grade vs app-grade dep classification table added to `02-architecture.md#Phase-6 extraction shape`. `ai-docs/plans/we-want-to-create-luminous-book.md` is the full planning record.

Surprises worth remembering:

- **Removing `SENTINEL_API_KEY` outright broke chat.** The OpenAI-family providers in `pi-ai` require `getApiKey()` to return *something* before the HTTP request is built, even though the real auth is via `Authorization: Bearer` headers patched in by `makeStreamFn`. The agent-loop chain looks like `(getApiKey(provider) ?? config.apiKey)` — if both are undefined, provider setup fails silently and the assistant reply is empty. Keep the placeholder; just name it honestly.
- **Dexie compound-index secondary sort is the entry id, not the timestamp.** Already documented in the M5 post-script but resurfaced here — when adding a test that writes many entries in rapid succession, the monotonic timestamp bump in `DexieSessionStore._writeEntry` is what preserves chronological order on read.
- **Sub-path import cleanup is cheap — just do it.** `VaultProvider` and `WebAgentProvider` had been reaching into `@/web-agent/fs/*` and `@/web-agent/worker/*` for single symbols each. Both symbols were already re-exported from the barrel; the fix was a one-line import edit per file. Not worth deferring.

### M6 — Session tree (done, _this commit_)

What landed:

- **`SessionStore.forkSession({ sourceSessionId, upToEntryId, id? })`** — atomic root-to-target copy in a single Dexie `rw` transaction, implemented in both `MemorySessionStore` and `DexieSessionStore`. Preserves source entry ids/parentIds/timestamps verbatim; skips `LabelEntry` rows; sets `parentSession = sourceSessionId` on the child row. Dexie path uses direct `db.entries.add(row)` to bypass `_writeEntry`'s monotonic-timestamp bump (D18).
- **`core/session/tree.ts`** — `walkPathToEntry(entries, targetId)` pure helper used by both stores' fork impls. Detects cycles + dangling parentIds with explicit error messages.
- **`SessionManager.fork(fromEntryId)` + `navigateToLeaf(entryId)`** — `fork` returns a loaded `SessionManager` for the child; `navigateToLeaf` is a synchronous in-memory pointer move with no persistence (D19).
- **WorkerAgentHost** — `forkSession(fromEntryId)` + `navigateToLeaf(entryId)` handlers, each draining `writeChain` and aborting any in-flight turn before swapping state. **Bug fix:** `loadSession` and `newSession` now also `await this.writeChain; this.session.abort()` before resetting — previously a session swap mid-stream would orphan the streaming buffer.
- **RPC surface** — two new commands (`fork_session`, `navigate_to_leaf`) + matching responses; `RpcClient.forkSession` / `navigateToLeaf` typed wrappers; `AgentSessionHost` interface gains the optional methods.
- **Per-message entry-id correlation** — `RpcSessionLoadedEvent` now carries `messageEntryIds: string[]` aligned positionally with `messages`. The Worker re-emits `session_loaded` after each successful append (inside the writeChain), so main's mapping stays current even after `navigateToLeaf` truncates the visible chat into a sibling branch.
- **React + UI** —
  - `useAgent.sessions` exposes `fork(entryId)`, `navigateToLeaf(entryId)`, and `messageEntryIds: string[]`.
  - `useSessionEntries(sessionId)` — main-thread liveQuery hook for the entry list (parallel to `useSessionsList`). Available for future tree-panel UI; not used in M6 MVP.
  - `SessionPicker` — forest rendering. Sessions group by `parentSessionPath` into a single-level indented tree with a `↳` glyph (`session-fork-indicator` testid) on forked rows + `data-parent-session` + `data-depth` attributes for e2e assertions. All M5 testids preserved.
  - `MessageBubble` — hover-revealed Fork / Branch action buttons (`chat-message-fork-action` / `chat-message-branch-action` testids) gated on the bubble having an `entryId`. Streaming bubbles have no entry id and no actions.
- **E2E** — `session-persistence.spec.ts` extended with 6 new `test.step`s covering: capture entry id → fork → picker shows fork indicator + parent breadcrumb → switch back → branch from earlier message stays in-session → forked session is deletable.
- **38 new unit tests.** 7 in `tree.test.ts`, 7 in `memory-store.test.ts` fork suite, 7 in `dexie-store.test.ts` fork suite, 6 in `session-manager.test.ts` (fork + navigateToLeaf + ephemerality), 3 RPC round-trip tests, 8 worker-host tests (fork copy, abort-on-swap, navigateToLeaf truncation, abort-on-load). 194 unit tests total (was 156).

Surprises worth remembering:

- **Bypass `_writeEntry` on fork — non-negotiable.** `DexieSessionStore._writeEntry` bumps the timestamp to keep the `[sessionId+timestamp]` index monotonic under same-ms ties. Calling it for fork copies would rewrite source timestamps, breaking the "DAG slice is structurally identical" property D18 promises. Direct `db.entries.add(row)` inside the fork transaction keeps source timestamps verbatim. The fork helper does still seed `lastTimestamp.set(newRow.id, maxTs)` so subsequent appends on the child stay monotonic relative to the copied entries.
- **`session_loaded` re-emission after each append is the cleanest entry-id sync.** Carrying `messageEntryIds` only on session swap meant the per-message buttons were stale until the next swap. Adding a separate "entry appended" event would have meant a parallel state-update path on main; re-emitting `session_loaded` reuses the existing handler, with `messages` carrying the same data (cheap re-render) and `messageEntryIds` updated to include the freshly-persisted id.
- **Per-message action buttons need `force: true` in Playwright clicks.** They're styled `opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100`. Hovering the parent bubble triggers the group-hover state and reveals them, but Playwright's visibility check still doesn't recognise `opacity-0` ancestors as "visible." Hover-then-`click({ force: true })` on the action button bypasses the check; the underlying element receives the click as expected.
- **`navigateToLeaf` doesn't change the active session id.** The e2e step that asserts "branch from here stays in-session" specifically checks `currentSessionId()` is unchanged after the action — that's the contract. Forks change session id, branches don't.

## Milestone gate

A milestone is only "done" when all of these are true:

1. `npm run check` at repo root is green (biome, tsgo, `check:browser-smoke`, `web-ui check`, `web-agent check`).
2. `cd packages/web-agent && npm test` green.
3. `cd packages/web-agent && npm run test:e2e` green (pre-existing `chat.spec.ts` plus any new spec the milestone adds).
4. `cd packages/web-agent && npm run build` green.
5. No new `any`, no new `// @ts-ignore`, no new `// @ts-nocheck`, no `TODO: revisit`-without-tracking-note.
6. A paragraph in this document's "Per-milestone outcome summaries" section describes what landed.

Skipping any item breaks the milestone contract. If a gate item cannot be met for a real reason, document it as a decision in `05-decisions.md` — don't silently bypass. See principle #9 in `04-principles.md`.

---

## Deferred to post-v1

**Shell / bash execution.** Browser has no process model. Post-v1 options:
- Extension that proxies to a user-run local helper (user opts in, runs a trusted binary locally).
- Web Worker-based JS evaluator bounded to `/vault` as a shell-adjacent tool.
- WebContainer-style in-browser Node runtime.

None of these block v1. An extension can add shell support when a user needs it.

**Multi-tab collaboration.** v1 is single-tab. IndexedDB-based storage tolerates concurrent tabs from a correctness standpoint (no corruption), but no explicit cross-tab sync is built.

**RAG / embeddings.** Can ship as an extension. Not core.

**Voice / audio modalities.** Outside the coding-agent shape. Out of scope.
